I will try to make this as bland and straight-forward as possible


1. first do npm install discord
and then pip install dhooks

2. make a webhook and then copy the webhook id

3. paste that into where it says "Enter your webhook" It 
should be a decently sized link.

4. Run the program.

5. In the terminal it should ask you to enter a message which is represented as an input as the varialbe "msg"

6. enter your message and click enter

7. it should appear in your discord server directly after.

Good Luck!
